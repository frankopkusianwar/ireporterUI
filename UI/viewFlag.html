                    <blockquote>
                        In February, 2010, the Government entered a deal with MÃ¼hlbauer, a German firm, to supply national IDs. Muhlbauer High Tech was allegedly contracted without open bidding as required by law.

                        The company was to supply and install equipment for production of the identity cards. The IDs were supposed to be used to identify eligible voters during the 2011 elections.
                        
                        But by February last year, the company had reportedly produced only 400 cards. Parliament learnt that the Government borrowed over sh150b to finance the project, which has never kicked off.
